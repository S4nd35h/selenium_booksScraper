# selenium_booksScraper
This project is a Python-based web scraping solution that extracts book data from "Books to Scrape" using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. It stores the scraped data in a MySQL database and a CSV file. Additionally, a PHP-based frontend is used to display the data with basic search functionality and sorting options by price and rating.
